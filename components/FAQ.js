        <p>
          Our scoring engine evaluates your profile across 6 key categories: Profile
          Completeness, Review Signals, Visual Content, Activity & Engagement, Website
          Performance, and Competitive Position. Each category is weighted based on its
          impact on local search rankings, and your total score (0–100) determines your
          grade from A (excellent) to F (needs work).

    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          We recommend auditing your GBP at least once a month. Google frequently
          updates its ranking algorithms and competitors are constantly improving
          their profiles. Regular audits help you catch issues early — like unanswered
          reviews, stale photos, or missing business attributes — before they impact
          your local search visibility.

          After running your audit, you&#39;ll get a prioritized action plan with specific
          steps. The most impactful improvements typically include: responding to all
          reviews (aim for 100% response rate), adding at least 10+ high-quality photos,
          posting weekly updates, completing all business attributes, adding services with
          descriptions, and ensuring your website is mobile-friendly and loads quickly.
